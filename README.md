A major challenge for Africa is food security and sustainability. At the same time, we are on the cusp of the fourth agricultural revolution in which robotic platforms sustainably improve production through precision agriculture tasks such as weeding, planting, tending, fertilizing, monitoring and more. Our goal is to bootstrap science and technology in Nigeria so that future generations of robotics platforms will be indigenously developed or tailored to address the local agricultural needs. We see robotics education as the first step and using robotic kits at varying levels of sophistication to motivate and train students to use technology to solve real problems. Furthermore, we seek plans to establish robotics competitions to inspire ingenuity and build a community of educators and students and researchers that will advance robotic solutions to the agricultural needs of Africa.
