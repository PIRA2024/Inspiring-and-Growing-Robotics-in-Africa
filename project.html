                Recently, there has been a rise in the number of robots being integrated into human space. 
                These robots are expected to evolve alongside humans and to interact closely with them. 
                They have also been presented as potential solutions to the growing needs in many sectors in developed countries. 
                For instance, in agriculture robots are seen as the future for tasks like soil monitoring and analysis, plant and animal inspection for disease detection, crop planting, weeding and harvesting and many more. In the health sector, they are deployed companions for elderly where they provide psychological support and render assistance to medical and caregivers. 
                In the manufacturing industry, robots provide logistics support, they move tools and products, carry out picking and sorting of products and more.
                It is important to mention that these robots are often developed to address peculiar needs in these sectors [1].  </h4>

                Recognizing the significance of robotics, many developed nations have over the years made significant efforts in integrating robotics education into their curriculum at all levels. 
                Starting from primary school, students are introduced to basic robotics concepts through interactive programs and educational kits. These initiatives aim to foster interest and curiosity, encourage children to explore the world of robotics from an early age.
                As they progress to secondary school, specialized robotics courses and clubs become more prevalent with hands-on experience in building and programing robots. 
                Thus, allowing students to gain practical skills while developing problem solving abilities and teamwork. 
                At tertiary level, universities offer comprehensive robotics programs that cover various aspects of the field such as mechanical engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration.
                Michigan State University has a number of registered student organizations that are pursuing robotics and AI, including two that are mentored by Dr. Morris. 
                These programs not only equip students with technical expertise but also encourage research and development in cutting-edge areas of robotics. Various user-friendly robotic teaching aids for STEM education have emerged. For instance, LEGO MINDSTORMS, Makeblock, Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, Robotify, BSD education, VEX-Robotics and more have been developed.

                Students assemble the robot’s hardware by assembling the provided parts and acquire programming skills by using the software. 
                STEM education and education by utilizing digital fabrication equipment have been actively adopted in developed countries. 
                These educational programs are viewed as necessary for the future of the younger generation. 
                Individuals do not need any special degree to learn the basics for programming these robots using these tools. 
                Unfortunately, in Nigeria and many other African countries, robotics education has not been officially incorporated in the curriculum for primary and secondary schools, although non-school “robot classes” and STEM classes are gradually being introduced as a type of private lesson in some private schools. This indirectly limits the extent to which young people who are the continent’s future in terms of leadership and innovation can participate in addressing pertinent challenges confronting the continent [2].

                  Problem Statement  
              </font></h3> </p>
              <p><h4>
                It is projected that by 2050, the population of the world will hit 9.6 billion, and this is speculated to result in an enormous strain on global food security. In the broad sense, food security entails that an entire population always has physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets [its] dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. 
                To meet the increasing food demand, global crop yields need to double in the next 25 years. The current agricultural techniques like selective plant breeding and genetic modification being utilized in many countries are not improving crop yields at a level required to match and avoid future food shortages [3]. 
                In Africa, it is estimated that the population will double, reaching 2.5 billion by 2050. Unfortunately, even though about 60% of the continent’s population is engaged in agriculture, the produce from this sector cannot feed its citizens.
                This has been ascribed to factors not limited to abiotic (drought, poor drainage, erosion, heat, soil acidity and salinity etc.), biotic (weed, pests, disease), plant-related (poor/weak shoots and roots, toxic products etc.), enablers (unfriendly government policies, technology, finance, poor investment and partnership etc.), and violent conflict in food producing communities [4]. 
                The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present an urgent and formidable challenge to scientists and society alike, highlighting the urgent requirement to transform agriculture and the food sector to achieve food and nutrition security, ecosystem sustainability, economic growth, and social equity over the coming decades. Specifically, through SDG 2 (zero hunger) [5]. 
                In view of this, several research efforts geared towards developing solutions aimed at addressing the challenge of food insecurity are being explored in many developed countries across the world. For instance, agricultural production systems are transforming from the traditional systems into precision production globally. 
                Precision Agriculture (PA) which is an innovative approach to agricultural production, characterized by the optimization of farm operations through data-driven decision-making, for improved productivity and sustainability is gaining ground in advanced countries. This modern approach to agriculture employs various technologies and tools such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), sensors, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to collect,
                analyze, and apply information about farm conditions. Utilizing this method, farmers can effectively manage resources with fewer manpower, reduce environmental impacts, and maximize crop yield [6, 7]. In comparison with the developed countries, there are low technical efficiencies and high manual labor-intensive practices among the smallholder farmers in many African countries and this leads to reduced agricultural output. Given this, it is therefore important to reduce the pressure on the agricultural sector and optimize the effectiveness of agricultural practices among the smallholder farmers in the region. 
                Therefore, to bridge this gap and improve on the annual agricultural yields of smallholder farmers, this project aims at inspiring and training students in building the needed capacity for developing indigenous robotic solutions geared towards addressing the challenges around agricultural production and food supply and sustainability in Africa.

                The project “Inspiring and Growing Robotics in Africa: Towards Indigenous Robot-Solutions for Agricultural Production and Sustainability" is geared toward the project results framework.
                The project seeks to investigate what is needed to inspire and instruct the next generation of African students to develop robotic solutions that specifically addresses agricultural needs in rural communities. 
                This is with the view of improving agricultural production and sustainability. <br>
                The Project will directly contribute to the achievement of this goal through four main intervention pathways. The four (4) main expected outcomes are: <br>
                <ol type="I">
                  <li>Organize a workshop for researchers, teachers, farmers, industrial partners and students to learn about needs in agriculture, share concepts and obtain feedback.</li>
                  <li>Develop curriculum and teach a short course in robotics to students and staff and other stakeholders</li>
                  <li>Organize intra-school robotic competition focused on the development of indigenous agricultural robot prototypes. </li>
                  <li>Follow-on proposals for external funding for project scaling and commercialization of developed prototypes.</li>

              </h4></p>
              <p><h4>
                The synergistic activities of the four outcomes will contribute to enhancing and expanding local, sustainable agricultural production and annual yields and the resulting indigenous robotic prototypes through a circular economy approach contributing to short, medium, and long-term improvements in agricultural practices, human nutrition and food security without damaging the environment.

                In comparison with the developed countries, there are low technical efficiencies and high manual labor-intensive practices among the smallholder farmers in Nigeria and many African countries and this causes reduced agricultural output and increased cost of farming.
                The project “Inspiring and Growing Robotics in Africa: Towards Indigenous Robot-Solutions for Agricultural Production and Sustainability" aims to address the urgent need to inspire and motivate future crop of young African students to “think scientifically and work technologically" with the view of developing indigenous robotic solutions geared towards addressing real-world challenges confronting rural farmers in the continent to ensure sustainable agricultural production.<br>

                To address the Results Framework, the project’s Theory of Change (TOC) will achieve the goal of building the needed capacity for the development of indigenous agricultural robotic solutions by providing robotic kits, teaching and learning resources, and hand-on training to 50 young African students. 
                This is to inspire students to develop robotic prototypes that address technical and labor related challenges confronting rural farmers which often result in reduced annual agricultural yields. It is our hope that this would lead to reduced agricultural losses and technical inefficiencies and above all improve food security on the continent.

                This project seeks to take advantage of the availability of low-cost robotic components as well as open-source software to jump-start robotics development in Africa.
                For instance, sophisticated computer vision algorithms that detect diseased leaves can run on a low-cost embedded computer with camera and guide a mobile platform to inspect crops. Initially, components will be imported with value being added through modifying and adapting robotic solutions for the needs of farmers. As skills improve a larger fraction of the components will be fabricated and sourced locally. 
                This project will leverage the support of industrial and academic professions both locally and internationals.
                Knowledge generated through this project will be available on an online open access database. Printed manuals/booklets will be developed and disseminated.
